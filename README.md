# Example of using Blender + fSpy to create augmentations of image data

## Installation
Blender 3.1.2 is required to run the demo. To create augmentations (add potholes) on your own photo, you will also need fSpy (https://fspy.io/) and the Blender addon (https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy-Blender) - Both are free and open source.
